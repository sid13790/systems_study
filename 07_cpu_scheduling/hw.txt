1.

response times = 0, 200, 400 respectively
turnaround time = 200, 400, 600 respectively

2.

response times = 0, 100, 300 respectively
turnaround times = 100, 300, 600 respectively

3.

response times = 0, 1, 2 respectively
turnaround times = 298, 499, 600 

4.

Workloads where the job lengths are the same, or jobs are in ascending
order by length.

5.

Workloads where the quantum length is the same length as the job length, and 
the job lengths are the same.

6. 

The response time increases with respect to the first job, since the first job
has the most effect on response time for all subsequent jobs. 

7. 

The response time increases for each job. 
The worst case response time with respect to N is (N - 1) * q
The average response time is ((N - 1) * q) / 2
